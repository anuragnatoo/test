Imagine being in a place where your presence feels overlooked, where you're only acknowledged when no one else is available. Would you want to be in such a situation? I know I wouldn’t.

This reminds me of vanilla ice cream at a buffet or a party. It’s always there, a dependable presence, but rarely anyone’s first choice. Guests scan the dessert counter for butterscotch, strawberry, or mango, only turning to vanilla when all other options are gone.

It feels unfair, doesn’t it? Vanilla has been steadfast, quietly enduring, yet it’s chosen more out of necessity than desire.

The lesson I draw from this is simple: it’s better to be someone’s mint chocolate chip—their unique, beloved favorite—than to be their vanilla, the fallback option. Never settle for being in a place where you’re not truly valued or chosen for who you are.
